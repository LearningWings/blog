## Learning How to Add and Subtract

### Math Computation can be Challenging for Children with Special Needs

Most second grade students enjoy practicing basic addition and subtraction facts, whether the problems are written on a sheet of paper, on flashcards or through playing math games. I spend a lot of time with second grade students who have extreme difficulty computing basic addition and subtraction operations. Students need to have a solid understanding of addition and subtraction by the beginning of second grade so they can learn to apply basic computational skills to more advanced processess, such as adding and subtracting multi-digit numbers, including regrouping.  When prevented from learning these more advanced grade level math concepts, it sets the stage for frustration and shut down, increasing the learning gap in future grades.

If you have a student who is struggling with basic adding and subtracting of numbers 0-10, no matter what grade they are in, the first step is to determine the place and severity of the developmental breakdown. For example, some students, especially those with more severe learing disabilities, do not have an adaquate understanding of numerical meaning and sequence. In other words, a student may not be able to add 2+1 because he doesn't really know what the numbers stand for, nor does he understand the concept of the words plus and equal. These deficits are not always obvious, partly because by second grade it is generally assummed that the child has already acquired this knowledge, and also because most students are able to copy numbers, though sometimes backwards, and either appear to be trying, or are completely distracted from the task.  However, these behaviors are often coping strategies students learn when trying to function in a classroom where expections are beyond their current instructional levels.  Added to Title

A child in this predicament is often doing the best he can. These students are rarely are able to articulate their specific needs.  It is important for teachers and parents to recognize at this point that remediation must occur at the student's developmental level to get the student on the right track to being a successful math student.

The following is a list of pre-requisites students must have before being able to add and subtract basic numbers 1-10 in a classroom setting:

1. The student must understand one to one correspondence, recognizing number values. For instance, if given counting cubes, the student will be able to place the equivelant number of cubes next to the written number.

2. The student must be able to consistently count to 20.

3. The student must be able to write numbers up to 20. (They may use a model as    a support)

4. The student must be able to recognize and read numbers.

5. The student must learn the meaning and symbol for the word plus.

6. The student must learn the meaning and symbol for the words equal and total.

Students who are missing any of the above skills will not be able to progress to the level expected of them in the second grade or beyond. Therefore, it is essential that these skills are remediated, in a way that will enable the student to gain and retain information.  Using a combination of direct instuction, a multi-sensory approach, repetition, and working with the child individually is often beneficial in these types of situations. If the student is older, easily distracted, or self-conscious, this is best accomplished in a more private area, away from the classroom environment. For teachers this can be a challenging task, but still often possible with some adjustments and creativity.   

The following process will allow you to evaluate the mastery level of the first four skills:  Give the student a group of counting cubes or other small objects. Write a number and ask the student to read the number. (skill 4) Then ask him to count out that may cubes and place them next the number. Repeat until you have checked each number 0-20. (skills 1 and 2)

Next, ask to student to write a random number from 0-20. Repeat until you have given all 20 numbers, noting any mistakes. (skill 3)

Once you gather this information, you will have a starting point. Trouble shoot and strengthen any and all areas that the student is weak in before continuing on to skills 5 and 6.     

Depending upon the student, this process may takes days, weeks or even months. It is important to focus intensely on improving these skills even though the student's peers are moving ahead onto higher level skills.  Once the student is at least 80% proficient at the first five skills listed above, it is time to move forward with skill numbers five and six, which will then lead into the process of learning addition.

To be continued!
