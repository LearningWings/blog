## Learning How to Add and Subtract

### Math Computation can be Challenging for Children with Special Needs

I spend a lot of time with second grade students who have difficulty computing basic addition and subtraction facts. Students need to have a good understanding of addition and subtraction by the beginning of second grade so they can learn to apply basic computational skills to more advanced processess, such as adding and subtracting multi-digit numbers, including regrouping.  When prevented from learning these more advanced grade level math concepts, it sets the stage for frustration and shut down, increasing the learning gap in future grades.

If you have a student who is struggling with basic adding and subtracting, no matter what grade they are in, the first step is to determine to place and severity of the developmental breakdown. For example, some students, especially those with more severe learing disabilities, do not have an adaquate understanding of number meaning and sequence. A student may not be able to add 2+1 because he doesn't really know what the numbers stand for, nor does he understand the concept of the words plus and equal. These deficits are not always obvious, partly because by second grade it is generally assummed that the child has already acquired this knowledge, and also because most students are able to copy numbers, though often backwards, and either appear to be trying, or completely distracted from the task.  These are all coping strategies students learn when trying to function in a classroom where expections are beyond their current instructional levels.
