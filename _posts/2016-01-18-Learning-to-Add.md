### Math Computation can be Challenging for Children with Special Needs

I spend a lot of time with second grade students who have difficulty computing basic addition and subtraction facts. Students need to have a good understanding of addition and subtraction by the beginning of second grade so they can learn to apply basic computational skills to more advanced processess, such as adding and subtracting multi-digit numbers, including regrouping.  When prevented from learning these more advanced grade level math concepts, it sets the stage for frustration and shut down, increasing the learning gap in future grades.
